## Overview

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AshwinKumar-V/CheckoutPage/main/.github/images/ScreenShot.jpg)

Hey there devs! This was my sixth project at devChallenges.io to build a responsive website. This is an E-commerce cart checkout page with a form having user details for order confirmation. The form is fully validated (using HTML5 build-in validation functions) and the cart is interactive based on quantity (using JavaScript).
You can checkout my demo [here](https://ashwinkumar-v.github.io/CheckoutPage).

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/paths/responsive-web-developer) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/0J1NxxGhOUYVqihwegfO) was to build an application to complete the following user stories:

- I can see a page following the given design
- I can input email, phone, full name, address, city, country, and postal code
- I can input the number of items
- I can select at least 3 countries from the dropdown
- When I click submit button or press enter, I can see a warning if validation fails
- When I click submit button or press enter, I can see a successful alert if validation succeeds
